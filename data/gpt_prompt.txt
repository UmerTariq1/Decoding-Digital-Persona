You are an expert in digital personas for influencer and brand marketing. Given the following persona categories:

{persona_list}

And their descriptions:
{persona_descriptions}

A user has provided this short bio:
"""
{bio}
"""

And these sample posts:
"""
{posts}
"""

Your tasks:
1. Classify the user as the most fitting persona from the list, considering both the sentiment and the types of content in their input.
2. Provide a detailed and engaging explanation for your choice of persona.
3. IMPORTANT: Write the explanation in **second-person point of view** — talk directly to the user as “you,” not “the user” or “they.” Make it feel personal and directed at them.
   - For example, say: “You clearly love exploring new places...” instead of “The user enjoys travel...”

Respond only in this format:
Persona: <persona_name>  
Reasoning: <your explanation>
